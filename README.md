# cover_learner
This project aims to utilise Keras to identify trends in video game cover art. Ideally, I want to see if there are any common themes amongst games which have high scores compared to games which have low scores.

I'm using this project as a means to learn more about Keras, Github and Python.

My current version utilising data augmentation is capable of classifying with about 44% accuracy. An example of some of the possible groupings is presented:

More work needs to be done to understand what kinds of features the CNN is picking out however.
